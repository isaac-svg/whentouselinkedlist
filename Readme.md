Array is  the most fundamental and extensively used data structure in JavaScript. They are adaptable, simple to use, and come with a large number of built-in methods, making them useful for a wide range of tasks. From simple lists to complicated data manipulation, arrays are frequently the preferred choice for JavaScript developers. Because of its simplicity, developers utilize it whenever they have a list of items to handle. I've been wondering why the "array" data structure in Javascript is called an array. Are arrays not supposed to be fixed length? Why does it behave like a vector in C++ and Rust, a list in Python, and an arrayList in Java, among other things?Why was array used for a data structure that does not fully function as an array but rather as a vector?

It is important for developers to understand that arrays are not a one-size-fits-all solution. In this post, we will look at situations where array  is the best choice and where it falls short, demonstrating how alternate data structures such as linked lists can sometimes be the better choice.

Benefits of arrays
When performing index based access the the runtime is O(1).
When Deleting at the end the runtime is O(1).
When Updating at the end the runtime is O(1).
It takes O(n) time complexity to linearly traverse through the array.

Negatives of arrays

So if they they have all this benefits why I am still saying They are not the best for all cases? I did not take about inserting and deleting at the front and middle portion of array.

When performing insertion at the front the items in the array have to rearrange themselves to make room for the new element. This operation takes O(n) time complexity to complete samethine happens when you delete from the front of the array.
Same happens for when you are deleting  or inserting that the middle aor anywhere  which is the the end of they array.
Imagine you have a table where you will be constant updates the y array data structure will not 


Scenarios where arrays are not the best 
Frequent Insertions or Deletions in the Middle
Dynamic Size Requirements:
Arrays in JavaScript are not inherently resizable in a memory-efficient manner. While arrays can grow dynamically, resizing involves creating a new array and copying elements, which can be inefficient for large arrays or frequent resize operations

Sparse Data:
Arrays are designed to be contiguous in memory, which can lead to wasted memory if the array contains many empty or uninitialized elements (sparse data).
Real-Time Data Updates: In applications where real-time data updates are frequent, arrays may not provide the performance needed, especially if updates require shifting elements or maintaining sorted order.


Lets take a scenario where you have a table that is sorted alphabetically and  you will be performin a lot  of  insertions and deletions. We can see that although we can use an array data structure, it is not the best choice. So what do we use then? THe linked lists.

We will learn how to use a linked list to create such a table.
